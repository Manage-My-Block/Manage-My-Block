[Provides multiple user stories that use ‘persona, what and why’ that outline meaningful features of project. Shows evidence of user story revision and refinement.]

The app will have 3 types of user:
- **Owners Corporation Manager**: This is an 'admin' role, they can CRUD users/issue tickets/notice board posts/meetings. They can also create data in the app such as adding contact information for services (plumber, elevator, electricians, etc), adding apartment numbers (to assign to users), approving the Owners Committee members, updating the budget balance. They can call votes, approve votes, and add minutes to meetings.
- **Owners Committee Members**: Owners Committee Members have all the abilities of a standard *Building Member* but can also cast votes when the Owners Corporation Manager calls a vote and CRUD issue tickets/notice board posts.
- **Building Member**: This is the standard role in the app. They can CRUD their own notice board posts and comment on posts. They can only read information about committee members, the owners corporation manager, other building members, services contact info, and issue tickets. They cannot create issue tickets, that needs to be done by a Owners Committee Member.
